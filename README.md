# OfflinePasswordEncryption
 An entire password manager in a single Python script with a Gui

## Instructions for offline usage
enco.exe is the compiled distribution ready version of enco5.py code, the latest version of this project, so that you can just click and run without having to instal python or and IDE on your computer.



## for devs
Clone the repo or copy-paste any version of the Enco.py codes.
Run the enco.py script.

Using the application will generate a key and a passwords.txt file that will be used to store the encryption key and encrypted passwords in txt file

### Warnings
Not guaranteed to protect your passwords, this tool is simple and is a way to generate passwords securely and store them locally without web interaction aside from initially importing the dependancies.

enco5.py is work in progress, the dark mode integration does not work well in the input field fonts currently and am working on a fix
