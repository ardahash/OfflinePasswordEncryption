# OfflinePasswordEncryption
 An entire password manager in a single Python script with a Gui

## Instructions

Clone the repo or copy-paste any version of the Enco.py codes.
Run the enco.py script.

Using the application will generate a key and a passwords.txt file that will be used to store the encryption key and encrypted passwords in txt file

### Warnings
Not guaranteed to protect your passwords, this tool is simple and is a way to generate passwords securely and store them locally without web interaction aside from initially importing the dependancies.

enco5.py is work in progress, the dark mode integration does not work well in the input field fonts currently and am working on a fix
